========

jointris is a tetris like game

Features:
- multiple blocks that can be joined together
- multiple players collaborating or competing
- custom shaped blocks and weird rotations
- exploding bombs

Since it is based on the stmm-input-gtk-dm library, it allows
to play with joysticks and multiple independent keyboards.
